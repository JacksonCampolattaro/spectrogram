# spectrogram

A live spectrogram visualizer for system audio

Initially inspired by the spectrogram in [Foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/)

The concept is simple: 
- Y-axis is frequency, so higher-pitch sounds appear higher on the plot
- X-axis is time, so new data is introduced on the right as the plot scrolls to the left
- Brightness is volume, so louder sounds are more immediately visible
